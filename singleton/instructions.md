The structure:


Explain what you want from the student.

give some information, share links etc.


writes instructions to run tests etc.

Good Lcuk


###For example:
# be-fullstack-TDD

Test Driven Development (TDD) - is a software development process that relies on the 
repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very 
specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.

#### PART-1. FIND_MIN 

1. Look at the file **find_min.py**. 

2. To follow TDD the first thing we have to do is write tests for given functions.
Fortunately for you I've already created tests. (look at the file **tests/find_min_test.py**)

3. Run tests:
   
        python3 -m unittest tests/find_min_test.py
        
    You will see that it ran 7 tests and all of them FAILED (failures=7)

4. Now, complete that functions in **find_min.py**

5. After running tests all of them should be passed.

6. Compare your answer with mine located in **answers/find_min.py**

7. Commit and push your changes
